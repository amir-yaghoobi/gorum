# Contibution Guide

This project welcomes all contributors.

This document is a guide to help you through the process of contributing to the project. This document assumes you have a basic understanding of Git and Go.

## Become a contributor

Become a contributor in four easy steps:

1. Read this contribution guide carefully.
2. Fork the [main repo](https://github.com/irgophers/gorum).
3. Choose an [open issue](https://github.com/irgophers/gorum/issues), create a branch and commit your changes. If it is your first commit, consider adding your name and email to `CONTRIBUTORS` file.
4. Create a pull request to the `master` branch.

## Branches and Commits

Select meaningful names for your branches. Use hyphens to separate words.

Write consistent commit messages. A goog commit message starts with a verb (Add, Implement, Fix, etc.) with a capital first letter, followed by one or more words in small caps (except for special names). Write short commit messages and do not exceed 70 characters for lines. Use backticks to quote names.

Run unit tests before commits.

Be consistent about architecture and project structure. Read codes before committing new changes.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests must pass automated build steps which run linters and tests, and builds the binary image. A pull request must have at least one accepted review to be merged.

## Coverage

Codes must have reasonable coverage with unit tests to ensure testable codes.

## Comments

Write useful comments for users. However, need for a lot of comments can be sign of a poor design.

Do not include copyright comments.

Do not mention yourself or another, except for `TODO` and `FIX` comments. Use `@` before Github usernames.

## Authenticity

Do not hesitate to include well-maintained and good quality modules. Do not copy codes from another repo.

Include only public modules and beware of their licenses and permissions.
